Hi, it's Marco!👨🏻‍💻 I live in London, where I work as an iOS Engineer [@Peak](http://www.peak.net) 🧠.

I build iOS apps 🍎, contribute to open source and study Computer Engineering. I became an iOS Developer in 2016 studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Italy.

I love basketball 🏀, books 📚, TV series 📺 , tech 💻 and contributing to open source.

I like what I do and enjoy learning new things in my spare time, which is the reason why I also started publishing articles on this website.
Writing for me is a way to document my learnings and to make concepts stick into my mind.
