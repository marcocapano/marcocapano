Hi, it's Marco!👨🏻‍💻 I live in London, where I work as an iOS Engineer [@Peak](http://www.peak.net) 🧠.

I build iOS apps 🍎, contribute to open source and study Computer Engineering on the weekends. I became an iOS Engineer in 2016 studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Italy.

I love basketball 🏀, books 📚, TV series 📺 , tech 💻 and contributing to open source.

Currently focusing on learning more about testing, threading and functional programming.
In my future I'd like to release an open source app and learn more about programming languages and graphics programming.
